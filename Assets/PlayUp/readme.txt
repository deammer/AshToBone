PlayUp Tools Plugin for Unity3D
----------------------------------------

What does the PlayUp Tools Plugin for Unity3D do?

PlayUp Tools Plugin for Unity3D allows you to import PlayUp levels from Google SketchUp to Unity3D.  It requires you to install plugins for both Unity3D as well as for SketchUp in order for it to work properly.  When exporting a level using the PlayUp Tools plugin for SketchUp, an XML level file is created which stores the location and scale information for your SketchUp components and groups.  These entities are then imported into Unity as prefabs. The plugin for Unity allows you to import the level file which will properly place the prefabs into your scene.


Requirements to get this plugin working properly:

1. Unity3D (Free or Professional Version)
2. Google SketchUp (Free or Professional Version) - http://sketchup.google.com/
3. PlayUp Tools Plugin for SketchUp - http://www.playuptools.com/


Do I have to buy the professional versions of SketchUp, Unity3D or PlayUp Tools to get this to work properly?

No. The PlayUp Tools plugin for SketchUp is free and works with the free versions of both Google SketchUp and Unity3D. 


What comes with this Unity3D plugin?

Included in this package is the PlayUp Tools plugin for Unity3D, as well as an example (located in the /PlayUp directory) of an already generated level file which you can import to see how it works.  In order to get the example to work, you MUST have the PlayUp/ folder to be directly off of the Assets/ directory.
